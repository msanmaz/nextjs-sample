# nextjs-website
Portfolio website created with next-js + react. A framework that I started to use recently with and loved the syntax and its capabilities


# Structure
The project was divided into 3 main folders: components, pages, and static. 
The components folder has JavaScript components such as Navbar, Carousel, Footer, etc. Meanwhile, the ```pages``` folder has pages made up with those components. Linking is done automatically thanks to Next.js, which I used.
